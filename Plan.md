# Serial Monogamy, Partnership Concentration, and Gender Asymmetry  
## Evidence from NSFH and Extensions to the Post-App Era

---

## 1. Research Question

When did gender asymmetry in access to long-term romantic partnerships emerge in the United States, and does this asymmetry predate online dating and smartphone apps?

Specifically:
- Did men and women experience symmetric access to marriage and cohabitation prior to the sexual revolution?
- If asymmetry emerges, is it driven by increased partner “churn” among women or by exclusion of a growing share of men from partnership altogether?
- Do post-app-era data indicate acceleration of an already-existing demographic process?

---

## 2. Core Hypothesis

Gender asymmetry in partnership access emerges in cohorts reaching adulthood after the sexual revolution and prior to online dating, implying increasing concentration of partnership exposure among a subset of men via **serial monogamy** rather than concurrent polygyny or generalized promiscuity.

Key implications:
- Dating apps amplify but do not initiate the dynamic
- The primary action occurs on the **extensive margin** (who partners at all), not the intensive margin (how many partners among participants)

---

## 3. Conceptual Framework

### Definitions
- **Partnered**: Ever married or ever cohabited (residential union)
- **Serial monogamy**: Sequential exclusive unions over time
- **Concentration**: A smaller subset of men accounts for a disproportionate share of women’s cumulative partnership exposure

### Accounting Identity
If:
- women’s cumulative partnership exposure remains high,
- male non-participation rises,
- conditional partner counts remain similar,

then concentration of partnership exposure is **mathematically implied**.

## 4. Core Dataset: NSFH Wave 1 (1987–88)

### Why NSFH
NSFH Wave 1 is uniquely suited to this question because it:
- surveys **both men and women**
- includes **full marital histories**
- records **residential cohabitation histories**
- predates online dating and apps

---

### Sample Definition (Wave 1)
- Respondents age **≤ 35**
- Birth cohorts approximately **1952–1968**
- Separate analyses by sex

---

## 5. Variable Construction (Wave 1)

### Extensive Margin
- **ever_partnered** = ever married OR ever cohabited

### Marriage
- **Number of marriages**: `M95`  
  (“Altogether, how many times have you been married?”)
- **ever_married** = `M95 ≥ 1`
- **remarried_2plus** = `M95 ≥ 2`

### Cohabitation
- **Number of cohabiting partners**: `NUMCOHAB`
- **ever_cohabited** = `NUMCOHAB ≥ 1`

All variables are taken directly from the NSFH Wave 1 public-use microdata.

## 6. Empirical Results: NSFH Wave 1

### 6.1 Ever-Partnered Rates by Birth Cohort (Age ≤ 35)

| Birth Cohort | Female (%) | Male (%) | Female − Male (pp) |
|-------------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| 1952–56 | 92.6 | 92.1 | +0.5 |
| 1957–60 | 88.4 | 85.8 | +2.6 |
| 1961–64 | 82.0 | 71.2 | +10.8 |
| 1965–68 | 56.5 | 31.6 | +24.9 |

**Finding:**  
Gender parity holds for early cohorts but collapses sharply for cohorts reaching adulthood after the sexual revolution.

---

### 6.2 Conditional Partner Counts (Among Ever-Partnered)

Across all cohorts:
- Mean number of cohabiting partners is **similar by sex**
- Mean number of marriages declines for **both sexes**
- Remarriage rates fall with cohort for **both sexes**

There is **no evidence** of runaway female partner accumulation.

---

### 6.3 Interpretation

The coexistence of:
- sharply rising male non-participation, and
- stable conditional partner counts

implies **concentration of partnership exposure among a subset of men via serial monogamy**.

This pattern is already present **before online dating**.

---

## 7. What These Results Do *Not* Claim

- No claim about conscious female strategy
- No claim about concurrent polygyny or “harems”
- No moral judgment about preferences or norms
- No claim that apps caused the initial asymmetry

The analysis is purely demographic and arithmetic.

---

## 8. Extension Plan

### 8.1 NSFH Waves 2–3 (1992–94, 2001–03)
Goal:
- Replicate identical definitions
- Test whether asymmetry widens within the same survey design

Key metrics:
- Ever-partnered by age ≤ 35
- Cohabitation counts
- Marriage and remarriage rates

---

### 8.2 Census / CPS (Post-2000)
Goal:
- Track never-married rates by sex and age
- Establish post-app continuation on the extensive margin

Strengths:
- Large samples
- Stable definitions
- Reviewer-proof

---

### 8.3 NSFG (2002–2019)
Goal:
- Confirm ever-partnered divergence
- Use sexual partner counts cautiously and secondarily

---

### 8.4 Pew Research
Goal:
- Provide contextual timing of app adoption
- Describe environment, not causality
